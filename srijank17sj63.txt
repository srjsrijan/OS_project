  * DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT 
  
  In the given question disk drive has 5,0000 cylinders,numbered 0 to 4999.
  Cureently pocess woking at cylender  143,
  and previously process working at cylender 125 .
  In this problem we have to calculate the total distance covered from the cureent position to the last cylender.

	       *COMPLEXITY
	       
	       The complexity of the above programme would be O(n).
	       Because in this programme we need visit each and every reqired cylinder 
	       to calculate the distance.
	       
	       
	       * TEST CASES

	       It actually the effective  total distance covered .*/

               # Description of project


        In the given question ,a teacher being served at the food mess and during the period when he is being served,
        another teacher comes ,then that teacher would get the food next.This process might continue leading to increase 
       in waiting time of students toget food.In this programme I minimized the waiting time of students.
       I overcome the problem with the help of first come first serve concept.
